# Mail Sending Program
This program is all about sending mail without opening any browser, entering username or entering password. It provides GUI to send mails which have same purposes. For example, I designed this program to send payment summary to customer. By entering their mail and selecting their payment summary file, it sends mail with predefined texts. You can change predefined texts based on your purpose.  

QT libraries and GoogleAPI was used in this program.
